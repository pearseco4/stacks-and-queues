STACKS: 

Last In First Out (LIFO). The most recent item added to a stack is the first to be removed.

It uses the following functions: 
1. pop(): Remove the top item from the stack 
2. push(item): Add an item to the top of the stack
3. peek(): Return the top of the stack 
4. empty(): Return true if and only if the stack is empty
5. size(): Return the size of the stack 

Sample code to implement a stack -> see overview.py
